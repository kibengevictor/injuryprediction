# 🎯 GNODE Hamstring Injury Prediction - Realistic Deployment Plan

---

## 🔍 **Current Situation Analysis**

### **What the GNODE Model ACTUALLY Needs:**

#### ✅ **OBTAINABLE by Regular People:**
1. **Biomarker Data (3 features)**
   - `mw` - Molecular Weight from lab results
   - `tissue_sweat` - Sample type (saliva/sweat/urine)
   - `tissue_urine` - Sample type indicator
   
   **How to get it:** Order metabolite panel test from:
   - Quest Diagnostics
   - LabCorp
   - Private wellness labs (Everlywell, LetsGetChecked)
   - Sports performance labs
   - Cost: $150-$400 per test

#### ❌ **NOT OBTAINABLE by Regular People:**
2. **EMG Signal Features (4 features)**
   - `rms_feat` - Root Mean Square
   - `zero_crossings` - Signal frequency
   - `skewness` - Distribution asymmetry  
   - `waveform_length` - Signal complexity
   
   **Problem:** Requires:
   - Medical-grade EMG equipment ($5,000-$50,000)
   - Trained technician to apply electrodes
   - Signal processing software
   - Clinical setting
   - **NOT accessible to general public**

## 🚀 **THREE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES**

---

## **STRATEGY 1: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)** ⭐

### **Concept:**
Replace technical EMG features with **proxy measurements** that regular people CAN provide.

### **Feature Mapping:**

| Original EMG Feature | Consumer Proxy | How to Collect |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| `rms_feat` (signal strength) | Muscle fatigue score | "Rate your leg muscle fatigue after 10 squats (1-10)" |
| `zero_crossings` (frequency) | Movement pain frequency | "How often do you feel pain during activity? (Never/Sometimes/Often/Always)" |
| `skewness` (asymmetry) | Left-right leg strength difference | "Can you stand on one leg for 30 sec? Left leg: Y/N, Right leg: Y/N" |
| `waveform_length` (complexity) | Range of motion limitation | "Can you touch your toes? (Easily/With effort/Cannot)" |

### **New Input Form:**

#### **Section A: Lab Results** (from biomarker test)
```
🧬 Biomarker Lab Results (Required)
─────────────────────────────────────
Upload Lab Report: [Choose PDF/Image]
OR
Enter Manually:
  Metabolite Name: [_____________]
  Molecular Weight: [_______] Da
  Sample Type: ○ Saliva  ○ Sweat  ○ Urine

Where to get tested:
• Quest Diagnostics - Metabolite Panel

• Everlywell - At-home test kit ($199)
```

#### **Section B: Physical Assessment** (self-test)
```
💪 Self-Assessment Tests (5 minutes)

Test 1: Muscle Fatigue
Do 10 bodyweight squats, then rate fatigue:
1 (No fatigue) ─────────●────── 10 (Exhausted)

Test 2: Single Leg Balance
Stand on LEFT leg for 30 seconds: ○ Success  ○ Failed
Stand on RIGHT leg for 30 seconds: ○ Success  ○ Failed

Test 3: Flexibility
Sit and reach - Can you touch your toes?
○ Easily (no discomfort)
○ With effort (mild stretch)  
○ Cannot reach (tight hamstrings)

Test 4: Pain During Activity
In the past week, how often did you feel hamstring pain?
○ Never
○ Rarely (1-2 times)
○ Sometimes (3-5 times)
○ Often (6+ times)
○ Constant pain

Test 5: Activity Level
Your typical weekly exercise:
○ Sedentary (0-1 days)
○ Light (2-3 days)
○ Moderate (4-5 days)
○ Intense (6-7 days, competitive)
```

### **Backend Processing:**
```python
# Convert consumer inputs to model-compatible features
def convert_consumer_to_model_features(consumer_data):
    """
    Map consumer-friendly inputs to technical EMG equivalents
    """
    features = {
        # Biomarker (unchanged)
        'mw': consumer_data['molecular_weight'],
        'tissue_sweat': 1 if consumer_data['sample_type'] == 'sweat' else 0,
        'tissue_urine': 1 if consumer_data['sample_type'] == 'urine' else 0,
        
        # EMG proxies (scaled to match training distribution)
        'rms_feat': map_fatigue_to_rms(consumer_data['fatigue_score']),
        'zero_crossings': map_pain_frequency_to_crossings(consumer_data['pain_freq']),
        'skewness': map_balance_to_skewness(consumer_data['balance_test']),
        'waveform_length': map_flexibility_to_waveform(consumer_data['flexibility'])
    }
    return features

# Example mapping functions
def map_fatigue_to_rms(fatigue_1_to_10):
    # Higher fatigue = lower RMS (weaker signal)
    # Training range: 0.03 - 0.25
    return 0.25 - (fatigue_1_to_10 / 10) * 0.22

def map_pain_frequency_to_crossings(pain_level):
    # Never=0, Rarely=1, Sometimes=2, Often=3, Constant=4
    # Training range: 8 - 13
    pain_map = {0: 12.5, 1: 11.0, 2: 10.0, 3: 9.0, 4: 8.0}
    return pain_map.get(pain_level, 10.0)

def map_balance_to_skewness(balance_results):
    # Both pass = -1.5, One pass = -3.0, Both fail = -4.5
    # Training range: -5 to 0
    left_pass, right_pass = balance_results
    if left_pass and right_pass:
        return -1.5  # Symmetric, healthy
    elif left_pass or right_pass:
        return -3.0  # Asymmetric, moderate risk
    else:
        return -4.5  # Both weak, high risk

def map_flexibility_to_waveform(flexibility):
    # Easily=0, Effort=1, Cannot=2
    # Training range: 3 - 20
    flex_map = {0: 18, 1: 11, 2: 5}
    return flex_map.get(flexibility, 11)
```

### **Pros:**
✅ Accessible to general public  
✅ No expensive equipment needed  
✅ Can be done at home in 10 minutes  
✅ Still uses lab biomarkers (clinically valid)  
✅ Maintains model architecture

### **Cons:**
⚠️ Lower accuracy (proxies aren't perfect)  
⚠️ Requires validation study to prove proxies work  
⚠️ Still needs $150-$400 lab test

## **STRATEGY 2: Lab-Only Partnership** 🏥

### **Concept:**
Partner with labs/clinics that HAVE EMG equipment.

### **User Flow:**
```
1. User visits website → Books appointment
2. User goes to partner clinic
3. Technician:
   - Collects biomarker sample (saliva/sweat/urine)
   - Runs EMG test (5 minutes)
4. Lab uploads results to platform
5. User gets prediction + report via email/app
```

### **Partner Types:**
- Sports medicine clinics
- Physical therapy centers  
- University athletic departments
- Professional sports teams
- Corporate wellness programs

### **Pricing Model:**
- **Consumer Pay**: $99-$299 per test
- **Insurance Billing**: CPT codes for preventive screening
- **B2B**: Bulk contracts with teams/companies

### **Pros:**
✅ Uses real EMG data (high accuracy)  
✅ Professional supervision  
✅ Can bill insurance  
✅ Revenue from partnerships

### **Cons:**
❌ Requires physical visit  
❌ Not accessible to everyone (location-dependent)  
❌ Higher cost  
❌ Slower turnaround

## **STRATEGY 3: Simplified Model (Biomarkers Only)** 🧬

### **Concept:**
Retrain model using ONLY biomarker features (remove EMG entirely).

### **Model Modification Required:**

#### **Option 3A: Retrain with More Biomarkers**
```python
# New feature set (all from lab tests):
features = [
    'mw',                    # Molecular weight
    'tissue_sweat',          # Sample type
    'tissue_urine',          # Sample type
    'lactate_level',         # NEW: Blood lactate
    'creatine_kinase',       # NEW: CK enzyme (muscle damage marker)
    'cortisol',              # NEW: Stress hormone
    'testosterone_ratio',    # NEW: T/C ratio
    'inflammatory_markers',  # NEW: IL-6, CRP
]
```

**Requires:**
- Retraining GNODE model with expanded biomarker panel
- New dataset collection
- Validation studies

#### **Option 3B: Simpler ML Model**
```python
# If removing EMG, could use simpler model:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Just 3-8 biomarker features
features = ['mw', 'tissue_type', 'lactate', 'CK', 'cortisol']
model = RandomForestClassifier()  # Doesn't need graph structure
```

### **Lab Test Package:**
```
"Hamstring Injury Risk Panel"
─────────────────────────────
□ Metabolite analysis (MW)
□ Blood lactate
□ Creatine kinase (CK)
□ Cortisol
□ Testosterone
□ C-reactive protein (CRP)

Sample: Blood draw + saliva swab
Cost: $250-$400
Turnaround: 3-5 business days
Partner Labs: Quest, LabCorp, Vibrant Wellness
```

### **Pros:**
✅ Purely lab-based (no clinic visit for EMG)  
✅ Can order test online, ship sample  
✅ Scalable to millions of users

### **Cons:**
❌ Requires retraining model (NEW research)  
❌ Unknown accuracy with biomarkers only  
❌ Still costs $250-$400  
❌ 3-5 day wait for results

## 🧪 **PROXY VALIDATION PLAN**

### **How to Validate Consumer Proxies:**

```python
# Research Study Design
study_participants = 200
duration = "3 months"

for participant in study_participants:
    # Collect BOTH:
    # 1. Consumer proxy data (fatigue, balance, flexibility)
    consumer_data = collect_self_assessment(participant)
    
    # 2. Real EMG data (in lab)
    emg_data = collect_emg_signals(participant)
    
    # 3. Actual injury outcome (ground truth)
    injury_occurred = follow_up_3_months(participant)

# Analysis:
# - Correlation between proxy and EMG features
# - Prediction accuracy with proxies vs. EMG
# - If accuracy drop < 10%, proxies are valid
```

### **Expected Accuracy:**
```
Original Model (EMG + Biomarkers):   94.2%
Proxy Model (estimated):             80-88%
Biomarker-Only (estimated):          75-82%
Random Baseline:                     50%
```

**Acceptable threshold:** > 80% accuracy for consumer use
