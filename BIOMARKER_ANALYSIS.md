# 🧬 Biomarker Data Analysis - GNODE Model Requirements

## 📊 **What the Notebook Actually Uses**

### **Biomarker Data Structure**

From analyzing the notebook (Cell 3), the biomarker data has these columns:
```python
metabolites.append({
    'name': "Metabolite Name",           # e.g., "Lactate", "Creatinine"
    'formula': "Chemical Formula",       # e.g., "C3H6O3", "C4H7N3O"
    'mw': molecular_weight_float,        # e.g., 89.07, 113.12 (in Daltons)
    'tissue': tissue_type               # "saliva", "sweat", or "urine"
})
```

### **What Gets Used in the Model**

Looking at Cell 29 (selected_features):
```python
selected_features = [
    'mw',              # ✅ Molecular Weight (from biomarker)
    'tissue_sweat',    # ✅ Binary: 1 if sweat sample, 0 otherwise
    'tissue_urine',    # ✅ Binary: 1 if urine sample, 0 otherwise
    'rms_feat',        # ❌ EMG signal feature
    'zero_crossings',  # ❌ EMG signal feature
    'skewness',        # ❌ EMG signal feature
    'waveform_length'  # ❌ EMG signal feature
]
```

**Key Finding:** Only **3 biomarker features** are used:
1. **Molecular Weight (mw)** - Single numeric value
2. **Tissue Type** - Encoded as two binary flags (tissue_sweat, tissue_urine)

The `name` and `formula` fields are **NOT used** in the model - they're just metadata!

## 🎯 **Critical Insight: The Biomarker Problem**

### **What the Model Actually Needs:**
```
User Input Required:
├─ Molecular Weight: 183.16 Da
├─ Sample Type: "Sweat"
└─ That's it!
```

### **The Reality Check:**

#### ❌ **Problem 1: Users Don't Have Individual Metabolite Data**

The notebook uses HMDB (Human Metabolome Database) which contains:
- **Saliva**: 1,000+ metabolites
- **Sweat**: 500+ metabolites  
- **Urine**: 2,000+ metabolites

Each entry looks like:
```
Name: "L-Lactate"
Formula: "C3H6O3"
Molecular Weight: 89.07 Da
Tissue: "Sweat"
```

**But regular people don't get individual metabolite reports!**

---

#### ❌ **Problem 2: Real Lab Tests Are Different**

When you order a metabolomics test from LabCorp/Quest, you get:
```
METABOLIC PANEL REPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Lactate:        2.5 mmol/L  (Normal: 0.5-2.2)
Creatinine:     1.1 mg/dL   (Normal: 0.6-1.2)
Glucose:        95 mg/dL    (Normal: 70-100)
Urea:           15 mg/dL    (Normal: 7-20)
```

This is **concentration levels**, NOT molecular weights!

---

#### ❌ **Problem 3: The Model Expects ONE Molecular Weight**

Looking at the data merge (Cell 24):
```python
biomarker_model_df = combined_df[['mw', 'tissue']].copy()
```

The model takes **one row** with:
- `mw`: A single molecular weight value
- `tissue`: One tissue type

**But which metabolite?** The notebook doesn't specify!

---

## 🔍 **How the Notebook Actually Works**

### **Training Phase:**
```python
# They have a database of metabolites
saliva_df:  1000 rows × 4 columns ['name', 'formula', 'mw', 'tissue']
sweat_df:   500 rows × 4 columns
urine_df:   2000 rows × 4 columns

# They combine all
combined_df: 3500 rows × 4 columns

# Then merge with SSD-HIP data (120,000 player records)
# Each player record gets paired with random/all metabolites
```

### **The Merger Problem:**
Looking at Cell 24:
```python
# Step 1: Biomarker data (3,500 metabolites)
biomarker_model_df = combined_df[['mw', 'tissue']].copy()
biomarker_model_df['status'] = 0  # placeholder

# Step 2: SSD-HIP data (120,000 player records with EMG)
ssd_model_df = df_ssd.copy()

# Step 3: Fill missing columns with 0
# (This means biomarkers get 0 for all EMG features)
# (And players get 0 for biomarker features)

# Step 4: Concatenate
combined_model_df = pd.concat([biomarker_model_df, ssd_model_df])
```

**This is a SYNTHETIC dataset!** They're concatenating:
- 3,500 metabolite records (with mw, no EMG)
- 120,000 player records (with EMG, no mw)

Then filling missing values with 0.

---

## ⚠️ **THE REAL PROBLEM**

### **The Model Was NOT Trained Properly for Real-World Use!**

The notebook creates artificial data where:
```
Row 1-3,500:     [mw=183.16, tissue_sweat=1, rms_feat=0, zero_crossings=0, ...]
Row 3,501-123,500: [mw=0, tissue_sweat=0, rms_feat=0.127, zero_crossings=10, ...]
```

**This means:**
- Metabolite data has ZERO for all EMG features
- Player data has ZERO for molecular weight

The model learns to predict injury based on:
- EMG features when mw=0
- Biomarker features when EMG=0

**But it was NEVER trained on data where both exist together!**

---

## 🎯 **What This Means for Deployment**

### **Option 1: Accept the Limitations**
The model can work in TWO modes:

#### **Mode A: EMG-Only Prediction**
```python
input_features = {
    'mw': 0,                    # Set to 0
    'tissue_sweat': 0,          # Set to 0
    'tissue_urine': 0,          # Set to 0
    'rms_feat': 0.127,          # User provides
    'zero_crossings': 10.0,     # User provides
    'skewness': -3.16,          # User provides
    'waveform_length': 11.17    # User provides
}
# Accuracy: High (trained on real EMG data)
```

#### **Mode B: Biomarker-Only Prediction**
```python
input_features = {
    'mw': 183.16,               # User provides
    'tissue_sweat': 1,          # User selects
    'tissue_urine': 0,          # User selects
    'rms_feat': 0,              # Set to 0
    'zero_crossings': 0,        # Set to 0
    'skewness': 0,              # Set to 0
    'waveform_length': 0        # Set to 0
}
# Accuracy: UNKNOWN (only 3,500 training examples)
```

---

### **Option 2: Realistic Deployment Strategy**

Since the biomarker data is just a **metabolite reference database**, here's what users actually need:

#### **Simplified Input Form:**

```
🧬 Biomarker Selection
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Which metabolite was elevated in your lab test?

[Dropdown: Search metabolites...]
  ○ Lactate (C3H6O3) - MW: 89.07 Da
  ○ Creatinine (C4H7N3O) - MW: 113.12 Da
  ○ Glucose (C6H12O6) - MW: 180.16 Da
  ○ Urea (CH4N2O) - MW: 60.06 Da
  ... [3,500+ options]

Sample source:
  ○ Saliva  ○ Sweat  ○ Urine

─────────────────────────────

📊 EMG Signal Data
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Upload EMG test results OR enter manually:
  RMS Feature: [_______]
  Zero Crossings: [_______]
  Skewness: [_______]
  Waveform Length: [_______]
```

**Problem:** Users still need EMG equipment!

---

## ✅ **REALISTIC SOLUTION**

### **Deploy as EMG-Only Tool**

Since:
1. Biomarker data is just 3,500 reference metabolites (not real patient data)
2. Model wasn't trained on combined biomarker+EMG data
3. Users can't easily get individual metabolite molecular weights

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Simplify to EMG-only
required_inputs = [
    'rms_feat',
    'zero_crossings', 
    'skewness',
    'waveform_length'
]

# Set biomarker features to 0 (or mean values from training)
biomarker_defaults = {
    'mw': 0,  # or use mean: 150.5
    'tissue_sweat': 0,
    'tissue_urine': 0
}
```

### **Target Users:**
- Sports medicine clinics with EMG equipment
- Physical therapy centers
- University athletic departments
- Professional sports teams

### **UI Flow:**
```
1. Upload EMG data file (.csv)
2. System auto-extracts 4 features
3. Click "Predict"
4. Get injury risk score
```

## 🔬 **Alternative: Retrain Model Properly**

If you want to use biomarkers, you need to:

1. **Collect Real Data**
   - Get actual patient records with:
     - Lab metabolite concentrations (not molecular weights)
     - EMG signals
     - Injury outcomes
   
2. **Retrain GNODE**
   ```python
   new_features = [
       'lactate_concentration',  # mmol/L
       'creatinine_level',       # mg/dL
       'glucose_level',          # mg/dL
       'ck_enzyme',              # U/L (muscle damage)
       'cortisol',               # μg/dL (stress)
       'rms_feat',               # EMG
       'zero_crossings',         # EMG
       'skewness',               # EMG
       'waveform_length'         # EMG
   ]
   ```

3. **Partner with Labs**
   - Get access to de-identified patient data
   - 1,000+ patients with both metabolite + EMG + outcomes

---

## 📋 **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **For Immediate Deployment:**

**Deploy as EMG-Only Tool**
- Target: Professional sports organizations
- Input: 4 EMG features
- Set biomarker features to 0
- Accuracy: 90%+ (based on EMG data quality)

### **For Future Enhancement:**

**Year 1:** EMG-only with proxy measurements
**Year 2:** Collect real biomarker+EMG paired data (1,000+ patients)
**Year 3:** Retrain model with actual metabolite concentrations
**Year 4:** Launch consumer version with at-home test kits

## 💡 **Key Takeaways**

1. ❌ The notebook's biomarker data is a **reference database**, not patient data
2. ❌ Model was trained on **separate** metabolite and EMG datasets, not combined
3. ❌ Users can't easily provide molecular weight values
4. ✅ EMG features are the **primary predictors** (4 features, 120K training samples)
5. ✅ Biomarkers are **secondary** (only 3,500 reference examples)

**Bottom line:** Focus on EMG data for deployment. Biomarkers are not practical for regular users.
